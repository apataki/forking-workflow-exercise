Fish Taco Ingredients:
Vegetable oil or canola oil – this is used in the marinade to keep the exterior of the fish from drying out.
Lime juice – this is the best flavor in these tacos it really brightens them up.
Fresh garlic and garlic powder – I like raw garlic in the marinade but powder in the sauce so it’s not overwhelming. If perferred arlic powder can be used in this marinade as well, use 1/4 tsp.
Chili powder, cumin, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper – these classic Mexican spices add a well seasoned layer of flavor to the fish.
Talapia, cod or mahi mahi – the idea is to use neutral flavored white fish. If you use talapia look for thicker fillets that won’t fall apart easily.
Corn tortillas – I like to warm them in a little vegetable oil or olive oil so they aren’t bland and dry until they get just a few golden spots then flip and cook on the opposite side.
Shredded purple cabbage – this adds that classic crunch we crave in seafood tacos.
Avocado – use a nice ripe avocado, it’s always a game changer.
Cilantro – feel free to add more to taste.
Cotija cheese – this optional ingredient adds a nice light tang, it’s one of my favorite Mexican cheeses.
Sour cream and Mayonnaise – these are used to make a creamy fish taco sauce. I like to use full fat for a rich sauce but low fat will work great too.
